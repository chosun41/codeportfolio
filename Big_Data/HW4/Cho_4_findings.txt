To uncover patterns by time, I basically took a sum of arrests across all days of the week, months, and hours of the day
instead of taking the average.

With hours of the day seen in Cho_4_daytime.txt, we see starting from 11 am - 8 pm, arrests seem to increase a great deal.
Wierdly enough, there seems to be no noticeable pattern with monthly arrests, although from the avg. monthly crime we saw
crime increase in the summertime.
Finally, arrests seem to increase linearly from Monday to Friday (peak), before decreasing into the weekend.
